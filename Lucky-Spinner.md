# Lamas Finance - Lucky Spinner

## Description

Lucky Spinner is a chance-based game in which participants have the opportunity to multiply their bet by spinning a wheel. 

The user may choose a bet amount from a range of options, such as 2 LMF, 10 LMF, 50 LMF, 100 LMF, or 500 LMF. The slots of the wheel feature numerous multiplier values, ranging from x0 to x35. The payoff is calculated by multiplying the bet amount by the outcome multiplier, and so there is the possibility of both gain and loss.

The Ecosystem pool will act as an intermediary during the game, collecting bets and distributing rewards.

Lucky Spinner uses Chainlink's VRF to ensure true and secure randomness.

## Reward

With luck, users spinning the wheel on the x2 box (or better) will earn a prize proportionate to their bet.

The following outcomes are available: x0 (complete loss), x0.5 (50% loss), x1 (break-even), x2 (double), x3 (triple), x7 (multiply 7), x20 (multiply 20), x35 (multiply 35) and NFT (x1 + 1 NFT card).

The table indicates the likelihood of each outcome.

[ROI - Proportion]
- x0 - 30.00%
- x0.5 - 30.00%
- x1 - 24.85%
- x2 - 6.00%
- x3 - 4.40%
- x5 - 2.20%
- x7 - 1.00%
- x20 - 0.40%
- x35 - 0.15%
- x1 bonus NFT - 1.00%

Accordingly, the expected value of winning is 0.973 ( = 0 x 30% + 0.5 x 30% + â€¦ 35 x 0.15% + 1 x 1%), approximately 1.

In addition, players who spin on the NFT box will receive an NFT piece. The rarity of the piece will depend on the amount of bet.

# Fee & tax

Participants must pay a negligible gas fee for the Solana network to participate in this game. For each transaction, this fee is 0.000005 SOL (approximately $0.001). 

Additionally, the winner is required to pay a small tax to the Lamas Finance system (in LMF), equal to 1% of the profit (payout minus stake). This tax will be split into two parts: 50% goes to Lamas Treasury and the remaining 50% is burned.

In the future, the ratio of tax to be burned and tax to be given to the treasury will be modified by governance voting. Additionally, users participating in staking on Lamas Finance will receive a reduction of this tax.
